/**
 * Apple/Metal counterpart of aurora/vulkan_interop.h, for the Apple Vision Pro
 * build (docs/visionos-port.md).
 *
 * CompositorServices has no notion of an application-owned swapchain, and
 * Dawn's Metal device is never handed to the compositor. So the headset side
 * (runtime/src/vr/visionos) owns IOSurface-backed images: Aurora imports each
 * IOSurface as Dawn shared texture memory and copies an eye into it inside the
 * frame worker's command buffer, and the compositor side wraps the same
 * IOSurface in an MTLTexture on its own command queue and copies it into the
 * drawable CompositorServices hands out for the frame. The two queues live on
 * the one GPU and are ordered with MTLSharedEvents (Dawn's
 * SharedFenceMTLSharedEvent), the Metal equivalent of the sync file
 * descriptors the Quest build uses.
 *
 * Every handle in this API is a plain C value so the runtime never includes
 * Dawn's C++ headers: an IOSurfaceRef or an id<MTLSharedEvent> travels as a
 * void*. Metal pixel formats travel as their MTLPixelFormat enum values, spelled
 * out below so a translation unit without <Metal/Metal.h> can name them.
